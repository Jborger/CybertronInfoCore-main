                        a fish-man and a bat-like creature. These monsters are 
                        searching for a man called Hawk, but when they do not 
                        find him, they order coelacanth-type monsters to destroy 
                        the ship. Watching the video of the attack and hearing 
                        of more attacks, Hawk realizes that he can no longer hide 
                        his identity as a Pretender. He and his fellow Pretenders

                        are forced to abandon their lives as normal humans and 
                        come out of hiding to protect a city. Things get complicated

                        Seacon Tentakil. Metalhawk is double-teamed but manages 
                        to defeat the Seacons with his sword. He is then confronted 
                        by Destron Pretenders Blood (Bombburst), Dauros (Skullgrin) 
                        and Gilmer (Submarauder) and beaten up on until the others

                        start building an army of zombies by stealing corpses 
                        from medical universities and imbuing them with evil energy 
                        from the Destron leader, Devil Z. The Destrons send the 
                        zombies onto a massive crime spree, causing destruction 
                        throughout the cities. The zombies tend to disappear when 
                        their energy runs out, however. The Destrons decide that 
                        they need to fuse the life energies of living humans with 
                        their evil energies to make it work correctly. To this 
                        end, the Destrons kidnap a number of boys, one of whom 
                        is Cab, Prince of the island kingdom of Karin. Discovering 
                        the Destrons' plans, the Cybertron Pretenders challenge 
                        their enemies to a fight to save Cab and the other prisoners. 
                        Cab befriends Shuta and becomes part of the team. Back 
                        at the base, Lander and the doctor are attacked, and the 
                        base is destroyed.</font></p>

                        in Cab's treehouse, the Cybertron Pretenders are stunned 
                        to hear about a second accident. They head for Corsica 
                        to interrogate Minerva, a young girl among the passengers 
                        involved, about the circumstances of her plane's crash. 
                        She tells them that the Destrons were indeed involved 
                        in the accident. Suddenly, more zombies appear along with 
                        the Destron Pretenders, wreaking havoc in Japan, but they 
                        are later taken care of by the Pretenders. Hawk and the

                        Minerva, her parents and a biologist. Suddenly, the clouds

                        Pretenders celebrate the completion of their new underground 
                        base at the foot of Mount Fuji. Shuta and Cab talk about 
                        wanting to be Pretenders or Transformers, just like Hawk. 
                        To celebrate the completion of the base, Hawk gives Shuta, 
                        Cab, and Minerva each a pair of special rings called Master 
                        Bracelets. He teaches them how to use these bracelets, 
                        telling them to yell out, &quot;Master force.&quot; Saying 
                        this caused an exo-suit to form around them, giving them 
                        incredible superhuman powers. Hawk then showed the trio 
                        their new transtectors (Transformer bodies) and so were 
                        born the Headmaster Jrs. (Shuta = Siren, Cab = Hosehead, 
                        Minerva = Nightbeat). Hawk then went into the history 
                        of the Headmasters, bringing up the example of Chromedome 
                        who spoke to the new Jrs. Having heard Wilder (Fangry) 
                        voice his desire for power, the Destrons decide to take 
                        advantage of his ambitions to try to win him and his little 
                        gang of thugs -- Cancer and Bullhorn (Squeezeplay and 
                        Horribull) -- over to their side, giving them their own 
                        set of Masterforce bracelets and transtectors. As the 
                        Seacons and Destron Headmasters attack San Francisco, 
                        Siren and the other Cybertron Jrs. attempt to rescue a 
                        woman's child in a burning building but are confronted 
                        by their Destron counterparts, who push them around. Fortunately 
                        the Pretenders show up and manage to stop the Destrons, 
                        and they manage to save the baby.</font></p>

                        rented because being inside it caused the driver to experience 
                        strange phenomena. Ginrai finishes delivering a cargo

                        earlier miraculously fixing itself. They go over the side 
                        of a cliff, the cab crashing to the ground and the trailer 
                        ending on top of it. Lander manages to escape before the 
                        crash, but Ginrai is still inside. Suddenly, Buster and

                        and doesn't know what is going on outside. The Godmasters

                        of Ginrai has greatly upset the Destron forces and Devil

                        attached to the cab, completing the 18-wheeler. The Destron 
                        Headmasters happen to be at a bar, where they turn on 
                        the television and actually see Ginrai on it. He transforms 
                        from his truck mode to his robot mode in front of the 
                        camera, referring to him as the Godmaster reserve. Now 
                        the Destrons are more determined than ever to find out 
                        who he really is. Ginrai continue to drive his truck, 
                        basking in the news of his television appearance, when 
                        Buster and Hydra formulate a plan to turn public opinion 
                        against the Cybertrons. They launch an attack, prompting 
                        Ginrai to head into action. He manages to defeat the pair 
                        with ease but it's simply part of the Destron plan. By 
                        tricking him into fighting them right in the middle of 
                        a city, they make him cause tremendous damage, leaving 
                        him standing alone to face the consequences. The pair 
                        continue to beat up on Ginrai as Seacons emerge from underground. 
                        Fortunately, the Pretenders show up to handle the Destrons 
                        and Ginrai manages to blow Buster and Hydra away with 
                        his super force. In the Destron base though, the Seacons 
                        have perfected a new form - merging into King Poseidon.</font></p>

                        starting the all-out attack that will begin his invasion

                        radar and radio destroyed, the base is as effectively 
                        isolated as an island. The Seacons press the attack against

                        Jrs from being trapped inside the base when it explodes, 
                        and he still has a one-on-one with Overlord, who he manages 
                        to defeat. God Ginrai ends up blowing up the base himself 
                        to free the Headmasters, Clouder and Lightfoot from certain
