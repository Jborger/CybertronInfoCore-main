                      the Cybertrons Apache and Lioconvoy are ambushed in an asteroid 
                      field by a Destron ship, and Lioconvoy apparently sacrifices 
                      himself to save Apache. The Destrons soon arrive at the 
                      planet Gaea -- they are searching for the planet's Angorumoa 
                      energy, and begin to drain it with a black, toxic cloud. 
                      From the moon, the planet's robot guardians, Artemis and 
                      Moon, sends outa distress signal. The arriving Cybertrons 
                      are shot down by the Destrons, but manage to escape planetside. 
                      But as Gaea proves harmful to the Cybertrons, they scan 
                      DNA from local creatures to give themselves protective beast 
                      modes.Approaching the Destrons' dreadnought, the Cybertrons 
                      are trapped by its defense systems and attacked by the Destrons. 
                      Suddenly, a mysterious white lion arrives and disables the 
                      security system, allowing the Cybertrons to overcome the 
                      Destrons. Disabling the ship, the Cybertrons escape into

                      white lion, the Cybertrons find their crashed ship relatively 
                      intact, and the lion reveals himself to be Lioconvoy. While 
                      repairing their ship, the Destrons find an alien computer 
                      that is linked to a sphere in Galvatron's chest. He activates 
                      it, drawing power and two new forms, but falls in a coma 
                      from the overload. Megastorm takes command and produces 
                      four protoform robots, then uses the computer to make them 
                      into the Autorollers. While the Autorollers destroy the 
                      forest to make room for a fortress, Megastorm uses the computer 
                      to give the other Destrons vehicle modes. The devastation 
                      attracts the Cybertrons, who rescue animals and stop the 
                      fires. Lioconvoy finds that the white lion who saved him 
                      is injured and pursued by the Destrons; Lioconvoy takes 
                      his place, allowing himself to be captured by B.B. When 
                      Lioconvoy is taken to the Destron base, he escapes from 
                      his net and scares the Destrons away.</font></p>

                      irritates the others, and they try to gradually talk him 
                      into calming down. The Destrons' activities worry Moon and 
                      Artemis, but they do nothing besides fretting over the situation. 
                      One by one, Bighorn finds the Destrons and challenges them, 
                      but most of them ignore him and fly away. He eventually 
                      confronts MegaStorm, the only Destron who can't fly, and 
                      a battle ensues. Bighorn soon gets the upper hand and scares

                      off a few, but is then caught by a defense system. The Destrons 
                      put him in a cell, but he escapes by using his beast mode 
                      to crawl through the ducts. Unknown to him, Starscream tracks 
                      his escape, even as the other Destrons harrass him. When 
                      some of the other Cybertrons arrive, they are caught by 
                      the security system, and Starscream threatens Kid to blackmail

                      even look directly at his Spark without being blinded. Galvatron 
                      goes out to fight the Cybertrons. He initially attacks in 
                      robot mode, but turns to his drill tank mode when the Cybertrons 
                      start to gang up on him. Scuba finally stops him by squeezing 
                      a watergeyser out of the side of a volcano; Galvatron is 
                      knocked into a crevasse, and the Cybertrons bury him with 
                      falling rocks. Galvatron then digs down and taps into a 
                      current of the Angorumoa energy being mined at the volcano. 
                      He accesses his third form, that of a dragon, and grows 
                      to immense proportions. He is delerious with power, but 
                      Megastorm blasts him from behind and knocks him into the 
                      volcano's lava. Starscream watches the ambush, but says 
                      nothing. Eventually, a battered Galvatron staggers in to

                      structure. They send a probe to survey it, but it is destroyed 
                      by a fast-moving blur. Lioconvoy decides to investigate;the 
                      Cybertrons draw straws to determine who follows, and Apache 
                      rigs the drawing so he wins. As they head for the ruins, 
                      Apache remembers when Lioconvoy saved his life with an emergency 
                      energy transfer, which is why he feels indebtedto Lioconvoy. 
                      They are spotted by Starscream and B.B., who bombs the forest. 
                      Apache falls while dodging the attack but is rescued by 
                      Lioconvoy. They run into the ruins; the Destrons destroy 
                      the entrance, and a nearby figure is unhappy about the damage 
                      to his lair. As the Cybertrons explore the ruins, Apache 
                      triggers a trap door. He falls into a chamber, and is greeted 
                      by a menacing giant praying mantis. Hearing Apache cry out, 
                      Lioconvoy doubles back and leaps into the now-empty chamber. 
                      Using tracking sensors, Lioconvoy follows a trail toa dimly-lit 
                      arena where Apache is held. Lioconvoy is struck down by 
                      a pair of flying blue discs; the praying mantis emerges 
                      from the shadows, transforms into a robot, hypnotizes Lioconvoy, 
                      and attacks him. Horrified, Apache breaks free, transforms 
                      to his gun-battery mode, and blasts the robot away. Lioconvoy 
                      thanks Apache for the rescue, but Apache has no recollection 
                      of his berserker rage. Just then, the ruins begin to crumble, 
                      and the Cybertrons dash for the exit. They encounter the 
                      mantis-robot as the floor beneath him collapses. Lioconvoy 
                      saves the robot from falling into an underground energy 
                      source, but the robot slashes at Lioconvoy, identifies himself 
                      as &quot;Mantis&quot; of the Insectrons, and flies off. 
                      Outside, Starscream gloats about how Lioconvoy is now dead 
                      and buried, then leaves with B.B. Lioconvoy and Apache reunite 
                      with the other Cybertrons. Lioconvoy thanks Apache for rescuing 
                      him, but Apache is confused, with little recollection of 
                      what he did...</font></p>

                      Brothers. Theyfail to find a solution, but Starscream has 
                      an idea -- if they kidnape one ofthe Jointrons, they can't 
                      form Tripledacus, and the Destrons can learn how the combining

                      of the last episode, Galvatron attacks. He briefly catches 
                      Magnaboss by surprise, but the combiner recovers, then stabs 
                      Galvatron's chest, opening a gaping wound. As the Destrons 
                      retreat, Skywarp and Santon explain that Galvatron is summoning 
                      Nemesis to Gaea to drain all of its Angorumoa energy. Enough 
                      damage has been done already that energy geysers are erupting. 
                      LioJunior feels abandoned by his father, but then finds 
                      out that his Matrix is linked to Lioconvoy's -- while it 
                      was healing Lioconvoy (in the first episode), the spirit 
                      of Gaea duplicated his Matrix and infused the copy into 
                      LioJunio's body. LioJunior could then grow slowly, becoming 
                      a tightly-integrated part of Gaea. LioConvoy and LioJunior 
                      open their Matrix housings to exchange energon streams, 
                      which stabilizes Lioconvoy. Meanwhile, Starscream and B.B. 
                      successfully save Galvatron's life. But the Cybertrons clearly 
                      have the advantage now, so Megastorm takes action and dips 
                      himself in Angorumoa. He panics at the last second, but 
                      falls in anyway, and is reborn as Gigastorm, a gigantic 
                      robotic dinosaur. He blunders about as he gets used to his 
                      new body, and nearly knocks Liojunior into the Angorumoa 
                      current. Lioconvoy saves his son; the two reconcile, then 
                      work together to drive Gigastorm back into the pit, where 
                      he drifts off.</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the start 
                      of the episode, Gigastorm has shrunken down to Galvatron's 
                      size and enters the ship. He checks on a few things, then 
                      uses his new power to boss everyone around before going 
                      on another rampage. Magnaboss is sent out to find Gigastorm 
                      and stop him. They lure him into an ambush in a box canyon, 
                      then shoot at the ground and the walls, burying him. Elsewhere, 
                      Starscream and B.B. are tracking the arrival of a spaceship. 
                      When it lands, a protoform called Ikard steps out, and asks 
                      them where he can find Scuba. The Destrons shoot at him, 
                      and he flies off. Meanwhile, Thrust and Dirge are using 
                      the Destron ship to winch Gigastorm out of his hole -- but 
                      he's knocked back in when Ikard crash-lands nearby. He steps 
                      out and greets his cousin, Scuba, then copies his beast 
                      mode and delivers Scuba's new Takotank. Trying out the Takotank's 
                      features, Scuba easily trounces Gigastorm, and then Magnaboss 
                      uses his &quot;Magnablade&quot; poer to blast Gigastorm 
                      away. Ikard then takes off, warping out of the system just 
                      before Nemesis arrives.</font></p>

                      gravity well. They send out a distress signal, which is 
                      received by both Artemis and Navi (the Cybertrons' ship's 
                      computer). The Cybertrons then spend most of the rpisode 
                      remembering their previous encounters with the Seacons, 
                      illustrated with clips from earlier episodes. Eventually, 
                      Galvatron contacts the Seacons and describes how powerful 
                      the Nemesis is, which cowers the Seacons into submission.</font></p>

                      day, Scuba and LioJunior are out (separately) enjoying the

                      sets out to investigate. At Destron HQ, Galvatron is slepping 
                      off a feast of Angolmois energy. Gigastorm attempts to kill 
                      him with a chainsaw, but fails spectacularly. Starscream 
                      and B.B. then arrive and try to stop him; Gigastorm breaks 
                      free and tries to overdose Galvatron with Angolmois, but 
                      this simply reawakens him ... just in time to see that the 
                      Cybertrons are now attacking their latest Angolmois pumping 
                      station. Galvatron seals the base, trapping the Cybertrons 
                      inside, then orders Nemesis to devour the rings of a nearby 
                      planet. Thus energized, Nemesis fires on the pumping station 
                      and destroys it. Galvatron and Gigastorm check for survivors, 
                      and are greeted with a free-for-all. During the fight, Gigastorm 
                      backstabs Galvatron, and the two struggle with each other. 
                      Before Gigastorm can win, however, the Destron ship arrives, 
                      and Galvatron uses its shrink ray to shrink Gigastorm to 
                      a harmless size. Victorious, Galvatron and the Destrons 
                      retreat, while Nemesis continues to approach Gaea.</font></p>

                      Starscream decides he wants some Angolmois energy for himself, 
                      and plots to sieze some from a recently-discovered source. 
                      Dirge, Thrust, and Gigastorm overhear his plans, and Gigastorm 
                      decides to lay a trap for Starscream. Meanwhile, Tasmania 
                      Kid has &quot;borrowed&quot; the Takotank for a joyride, 
                      but soon loses control and sends it careening towards the

                      LioJunior runs after it, followed by Cybertrons worried 
                      that he's going to get into trouble. At the new Angolmois 
                      vein, Gigastorm has just laid explosive charges when everyone 
                      arrives, so he hides behind a mountain. Scuba deactivates 
                      the runaway Takotank, but then Starscream and BB show up. 
                      The jets bombard the area, but the Cybertrons burst free 
                      and fight back. After a quick rout, Starscram and BB surrender 
                      and plead to change allegiances. Angered at this, Gigastorm 
                      triggers his bombs, dropping the two traitors into the Angolmois. 
                      They emerge as Hellscream and Max B, and re-attack the Cybertrons 
                      with their newfound powers. The Cybertrons are on the ropes 
                      until Scuba grabs them with the Takotank and hauls them 
                      into the Angolmois. Hellscream and Max B emerge near Gigastorm, 
                      but Galvatron arrives before a fight can break out. The 
                      Destrons retreat, while Artemis becomes even more infatuated

                      and Magnaboss fight the suicidal computer, but can't defeat 
                      its regenerating claws. Navi goes for help, but is temporarily 
                      thwarted by the Destrons until Galvatron calls them off. 
                      Sending the others away, Galvatron sneaks into the cavern 
                      and watches from the shadows. The Cybertrons try attacking 
                      a weak point in the computer's defenses so Navi can get 
                      through, but are unsuccessful. Unseen by the Cybertrons, 
                      Galvatron unleashes a Matrix Blast that breaks through. 
                      Immediately, Navi goes in and frees the alien emissary, 
                      who puts the moon back in its orbit. Afterward, LioConvoy 
                      confronts Galvatron and reveals that he knew about Galvatron's 
                      help. Galvatron sneers that he helped only to save himself, 
                      then shoots LioConvoy. Galvatron retreats before the other 
                      Cybertrons can arrive, then uses his ship to bombard the 
                      computer to prevent a future calamity.</font></p>

                      approaching Gaea, the Insectrons are building a starship 
                      capable of reaching Nemesis. Hellscream learns of their 
                      plans, and the Destrons attack the secret hangar. The battle 
                      turns against the Cybertrons, forcing them to jury-rig a 
                      booster rocket and launch the ship immediately. Magnaboss, 
                      the Takotank and the original Cybertron crew manage to get 
                      into the ship, leaving the Jointrons and Insectrons behind. 
                      As the Cybertrons prepare to launch, the Destrons attack 
                      the launch ramp, and only a last-second save by Tripledacus 
                      enables them to take off. Now the Cybertrons are in space, 
                      with the Destron ship in hot pursuit...</font></p>

                      fly towards Nemesis, the Seacon ship comes out and fires 
                      on them. Shocked and outgunned, the Cybertrons crash-land 
                      on an asteroid for repairs. The Seacon ship lands nearby, 
                      but when LioConvoy investigates, he's attacked by the Angolmois-corrupted 
                      Seacons. Magnaboss challenges God Neptune, but the Seacons 
                      are winning until the Cybertrons pile onto them. Magnaboss 
                      fires an Angolmois ball that un-mesmerizes the Seacons; 
                      Halfshell then reveals (while Scylla searches for her sweetheart, 
                      Scuba) that Galvatron plans to destroy Gaea after draining 
                      it of Angolmois. The Cybertrons now have insufficient fuel 
                      to reach Nemesis; Artemis uses the Great Computer to calculate 
                      a slingshot orbit, and Moon tells LioJunior of the plan. 
                      With Artemis' help, the Cybertrons slingshot around the 
                      moon with enough speed to reach Nemesis, leaving the Seacons 
                      behind on the asteroid.</font></p>

                      reach Nemesis as it reaches high orbit over Gaea, but Galvatron 
                      fires Nemesis' defense cannons and blasts the ship down. 
                      Gigastorm and the Cyborgs check for survivors, but the ship 
                      is empty -- and explodes in their faces. Meanwhile, the 
                      Cybertrons reach Nemesis with the Takotank, far away. They 
                      find an entry into Nemesis, whereupon LioConvoy selects 
                      Scuba and the Takotank to follow him in on a suicide mission. 
                      The Destrons then attack; Scuba and LioConvoy duck inside 
                      Nemesis, but are quickly trapped. While the others battle 
                      outside, Galvatron appears and attacks LioConvoy. Though 
                      outmatched, LioConvoy sends Scuba to destroy the Nemesis 
                      while he holds off Galvatron. Scuba soon finds the power 
                      core, but then Galvatron breaks off the fight and mindlinks 
                      with Nemesis. On Gaea, Angolmois energy surges towards Nemesis, 
                      flooding the ship and temporarily stopping the fights. LioJunior 
                      senses that Lioconvoy's spark is in danger, and rushes in...</font></p>

                      corridors of Angolmois, LioJunior finds Galvatron, who warns 
                      that Lioconvoy is beyond help. Ignoring him, LioJunior rushes 
                      on, while Galvatron goes topside and tells everyone the 
                      Lios are as good as dead. Santon and Skywarp try to rescue 
                      LioJunior, but Galvatron blocks them; full of Angolmois, 
                      Galvatron easily shrugs off the Cybertrons' attacks. In 
                      desperation, Artemis uses the Great Computer to move the 
                      moon and blocks the Angolmois flow from Gaea, as the energy 
                      starts to kill Moon. LioConvoy is now seething with green 
                      energy but trapped in a sphere of evil Angolmois; LioJunior 
                      finds him, and leaps into the sphere. As the Destrons topside 
                      slowly defeat the Cybertrons, one of the Angolmois collectors 
                      glows green, then erupts as the Lion of Gaea, the Green 
                      Warrior, arises! Galvatron orders Gigastorm to attack, but 
                      the attacks don't affect the green lion, who brutally counterstrikes.</font></p>

                      by the green lion, Gigastorm apologizes to Galvatron for 
                      failing with his last breath. Swearing vengeance for his 
                      brother, Galvatron rams the Green Warrior, splitting him 
                      into Lioconvoy and LioJunior. Before the fight can continue, 
                      the Takotank bursts through and Scuba quickly announces 
                      that he's rigged Nemesis to explode. Galvatron doesn't care; 
                      he flies off to another part of the Nemesis, and the Lios 
                      follow to finish their duel. Things turn from bad to worse: 
                      Artemis' control center disintegrates from the Angolmois, 
                      Dirgegun and Thrustol destroy the Seacons on the asteroid, 
                      and Hellscream and Max B kill Santon and Skywarp. At their 
                      dueling ground, Galvatron charges with evil Angolmois and 
                      grows to gigantic size, but the Lios merge into the Green 
                      Warrior, then fill the area with good Angolmois to counterattack. 
                      Nemesis starts to shake in its death throes, and Scuba steals 
                      the Destron ship to rescue the remaining Cybertrons. A jolt 
                      of Angolmois reawakens Gigastorm, and the Destrons ride 
                      him to escape as well. Back at the dueling ground, Galvatron 
                      is defeated, and the Green Warrior seals the Angolmois in 
                      capsules to prevent its future use. But Galvatron reveals 
                      that the spark crystal in his chest has a self-destruct 
                      device, and he will activate it to destroy the Lios. The 
                      two sides fight again, and Galvatron seriously wounds both 
                      Cybertrons. The Lios merge again into the Green Warrior; 
                      with a final thrust, they drive their swords into Galvatron's 
                      chest, causing a cataclysmic explosion. In the end, Nemesis 
                      is destroyed, along with the Cybertrons, who heroically 
                      follow LioConvoy and LioJunior into the Matrix. Artemis 
                      and Moon barely survive, and Gigastorm and the remaining 
                      Destrons are left arguing as they drift helplessly through
