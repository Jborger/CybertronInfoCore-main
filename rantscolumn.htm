                            since the end of Beast Machines it seems like the 
                            TF Community, as a whole has started to slow down. 
                            Its like we have hit a pot hole, and where stuck, 
                            not knowing what to do. With the return of vehicle 
                            Transformers in late 2001, it seemed like Hasbro was 
                            running out of ideas, it was basically like they put 
                            a new spin of G1, by putting G1 in a pretty new package 
                            and sent it out for us to &quot;buy&quot;. Now don't 
                            get me wrong I loved the return of vehicles, in RID, 
                            but the somehow it felt like there was a &quot;hole&quot;, 
                            if you want to say, left in the Community. By this 
                            I mean that at the end of the Beast Era, I had to 
                            say goodbye to the characters that got me back into 
                            Transformers. Yes I know the toys for BM, where well 
                            below par; compared to BW, but BM was special. And 
                            in my opinion was one of the best layout, and displayed 
                            series in the entire TF community, American, and Japanese. 
                            The way Megatron came off, as just pure evil, obliterating 
                            every Transformer on Cybertron, taking over the planet, 
                            and leaving the Good guys thinking, hey we may not 
                            win this one. I loved how at least this one time Evil, 
                            actually had a chance to win. And yes I was pulling 
                            for Megatron at the End of BM. His character came 
                            full circle at the end. Where in the beginning he 
                            was leading a ragtag group devious Predicons plotting 
                            to over through him around every corner. Then he evolved. 
                            At the End of BM, he had everything perfect. One central 
                            being making ALL the choices. Not everyone trying 
                            to work to over through him, or work to obliterate 
                            the Maximals, just Megatron the Generals (who he had 
                            full control over) and millions of drones. I remember 
                            at the beginning of BW thinking that the Predicons 
                            has no chance, Primal will waste all of you. But as 
                            the Beast Era continued I remember thinking that, 
                            evil might win this one, and it would be cool if they 
                            did. And since that show I haven�t had a feeling like 
                            that. It like every time I watched RID or Armada I 
                            knew that the Autobots are going to win; I just get 
                            this feeling of &quot;oh yeah I know the good guys 
                            are going to win&quot; there is no complexity left 
                            in the shows. Now I know that RID and especially Armada 
                            were/are intended to target little kids, but the need 
                            some sort of complexity, in order to keep the older 
                            fans happy with the product.</font></p>
                          <p align="center"><font size="-1">Then with RID, yeah 
                            the character were ok, the toys in my opinion were 
                            good, and the show ok. But I remember thinking oh 
                            wait this episode reminds me of a G1 episode, or a 
                            MasterForce episode. It was almost like they were 
                            starting to run out of ideas when the creators of 
                            the show were writing it. Bringing back the Headmaster, 
                            bringing back the Beast as Predicons. Yeah it was 
                            nice to see Fort Max on TV again, but if I wanted 
                            to see the real Fort Max I will throw in a Headmasters 
                            tape and watch that. Using old molds for the toys, 
                            which in some ways was nice, but in some degree, subtracted 
                            for the overall product. I wanted mostly newer stuff; 
                            when I saw those gobots, and the Beast repaints, and 
                            the Japanese Max repaints, I was thinking, oh yeah 
                            I already have those. And I know that Takara probably 
                            did that to help save money, but it came off a little 
                            cheap. The characters themselves on a level of complexity 
                            were poorly constructed, but on appearance were ok. 
                            What I mean is that Prime was always sitting back 
                            at the base waiting for the bad guys to make the first 
                            move, he never took the battle to them(except at the 
                            end), but we had to sit thought 37 episodes of the 
                            bad guys bringing it. In the last episodes the Autobots 
                            started to step their game up little but by then it 
                            was too late, we already new the outcome. And it was 
                            disappointing seeing a show that could have some much 
                            potential, in my opinion do a mediocre performance.</font></p>
                          <p align="center"><font size="-1">Then came Armada. 
                            </font></p>
                          <p align="center"><font size="-1">When I first saw the 
                            toys for Armada back in February of 2002 I started 
                            thinking, man those sure look like little kids toys. 
                            But as the release date for Armada came closer and 
                            I started seeing the final production pictures I started 
                            thinking that this could have potential. With the 
                            Minicon gimmick and the possibilities involved with 
                            that. But when I bought my first Armada toy, Optimus 
                            Prime, and removed him from the packaging I said to 
                            myself, its a shame that such a good toy line has 
                            come to no articulation, and no detail. About this 
                            time Armada started to air on Cartoon Network. I remember 
                            think holy crap this show sucks, compared to every 
                            past show that was put out under the Transformers 
                            name. The animation was horrible, and the character 
                            designs made me sick, but there was a constant, the 
                            &quot;complexless&quot; story lines and the knowledge 
                            of the Autobots always wining were still there. As 
                            the show rolled on I stopped watching it. Then came 
                            the mini Prime with Overrun. Those toys changed my 
                            perspective on Armada, hey maybe these toys could 
                            be actually cool. But in my mind the show itself still 
                            was lacking below my expectations. Finally came the 
                            toy that I had waited for ever since I had seen TFTM, 
                            Unicron. That particular toy made me tune back in 
                            to Armada, hoping to see him on TV again. I know that 
                            Armada is making huge bucks for Hasbro and everyone 
                            involved, but they have received very little of my 
                            money. And I was happy. Even thought the show still 
                            had the complexless story lines, annoying kids, horrible 
                            character architecture, horrible animation, and so 
                            on and so forth. I had at least, for that time made 
                            my peace with the show. </font></p>
                          <p align="center"><font size="-1">As I look into the 
                            future of what possibilities await us for the Transformers 
                            Universe I see the same thing repeating it self over 
                            again. Energon, look like it will have some decent 
                            toys, but the rest aren�t looking to pretty, and again 
                            a less the par show, but this all remains to be seen. 
                            Its like we have hit a huge pot hole on the road of 
                            the Transformers history, and we will keep spinning 
                            in that hole until something changes in the layout 
                            of the storylines, character development, quality, 
                            and so on and so forth. There is however a simple 
                            answer to all of this. It�s called two little sub 
                            lines that are called Transformers Universe, and Transformers 
                            Alternators.</font></p>
                          <p align="center"><font size="-1">The Universe line 
                            has endless possibilities if it were to be made into 
                            a show; incorporating all the &quot;Universes&quot; 
                            in Transformers history into one. Not separate communities/separate 
                            �Universes� like we have now. But a conclusion to 
                            all that is Transformers History. And then from there 
                            move on. Reinvent Transformers, do something new. 
                            We were left with holes that need to be filled in 
                            Universe could potentially do this, with the right 
                            direction and the right show. Thus bringing the complexity 
                            back into the show, and the Fandom, and picking up 
                            were we left off with previous shows. Even though 
                            the toys themselves are all repaints Hasbro could 
                            make new character, in new mold that we haven�t seen 
                            yet. But I foresee that not happening and just like 
                            the WWF/E and the Sports Entertainment industry in 
                            whole, Transformers will fade into the pages of History 
                            of pop culture in about 5-10 years. Unless something 
                            is done now.<br>
