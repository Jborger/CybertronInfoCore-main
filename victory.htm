                          is 2025 AD. Since escaping from Earth, the Destrons 
                          have continued their invasion of planets all over the 
                          universe in search of a new base. To defend against 
                          them, the Cybertrons have joined forces with the people 
                          of Earth, forming the Space Defense Force, led by their 
                          mightiest warrior, Star Saber. One day, Wingwaver reports 
                          to Star Saber that the Destron Dinoforce have attacked 
                          the Moon, heading toward Earth. The Brainmasters -- 
                          Blacker, Laster and Braver -- move to investigate reports 
                          of Destron activity and face off against the Dinoforce 
                          on the Moon. Star Saber heads toward the Moon as well, 
                          then encounters a strange energy in space which turns 
                          out to be the Destron commander, Deathsaurus. The other 
                          Multiforce members -- Dashtacker and Machtackle -- arrive 
                          to remove the people from the Moon station as Star Saber 
                          defeats the Dinoforce before he and Deathsaurus do battle

                          to steal Earth's energy. Leozak then orders the Dinoforce 
                          leader, Goryu, to take the others and destroy Galaxy 
                          Shuttle at the Cybertron base. Goryu comically rouses

                          encountering Wingwaver, who is on patrol, on the way. 
                          The Brainmasters then head out to aid Wingwaver in his 
                          battle against the Dinoforce and begin to overwhelm 
                          their opponents. As a result, the Dinoforce merge into

                          fire more missiles. There is no way that Star Saber 
                          can reach the missiles in his current state, so he brings 
                          up the idea of merging with Victory Leo. Star Saber 
                          shows up and tries to convince Victory Leo to merge 
                          - after a brief struggle, they merge into Victory Saber. 
                          Deathsaurus realizes that he will get there before the 
                          missiles are launched, so he attacks Victory Saber. 
                          He is met with a huge blast from Victory Saber's cannon 
                          and is sent hurtling through space.</font></p>

                          work on repairing Sky Stalker, Deathsaurus lashes out 
                          in anger and frustration at his latest defeat. Jan, 
                          who wants to help the Cybertrons more, designs a special 
                          sort of mecha for himself, a car which is able to walk. 
                          The car makes Jan rather popular at his school, especially 
                          with his female friend, Ilumina. Meanwhile, the Dinoforce 
                          hide in the forest, prepared to attack the school to 
                          draw out Star Saber. Suddenly, they strike, aiming at 
                          Jan's mecha, but missing. They charge, firing at the 
                          school and doing significant damage to it. Star Saber, 
                          who has been in space, hears a report from Holi of Destron 
                          activity and heads for the school. Just as Jan is about 
                          to crushed by Goryu, Star Saber and Victory arrive and 
                          they face attack from the entire Dinoforce. Jan fires 
                          his mecha's smokescreen bombs, giving him a chance to 
                          escape and allowing Victory Saber to face and defeat 
                          Dinoking. Just as Victory Saber has the chance to kill 
                          the Dinoforce, they beg for forgiveness and he gives 
                          it to them.</font></p>

                          relatively peaceful time, Star Saber decides to leave 
                          Earth for a meeting at Defense Headquarters. Blacker 
                          orders Jan and the rest of the Rescue Squad to do some 
                          spring cleaning around the base, when they suddenly 
                          notice Star Saber return. He reports that he heard that 
                          the Destrons had planted a bomb inside the base and 
                          orders everyone to start looking for it. When the bomb 
                          is finally found, Victory Leo reports it to Star Saber 
                          and is surprised by his somewhat-flippant response. 
                          He suggests that something might be wrong with Star 
                          Saber, but no one will listen to him, despite Star Saber's 
                          little slips. Star Saber and Victory Leo check out some 
                          abandoned ruins, where the Breastforce lie in waiting. 
                          There, Victory Leo accuses Star Saber of being an impostor. 
                          The Brainmasters show up and try to figure out who is 
                          telling the truth. Suddenly, the real Star Saber shows 
                          up and merges with Victory Leo to form Victory Saber, 
                          while the fake Star Saber is revealed to be Leozak, 
                          who then merges with the other Breastforce into Liocaesar.</font></p>

                          for metal. The Destrons capture many of these doria, 
                          with the intention of planting them within the Cybertrons 
                          and allowing them to eat away at their enemies. Star 
                          Saber explores a huge crater in the middle of the desert, 
                          and finds himself in a trap, caught inside a barrier

                          more powerful than anything they have seen before. The 
                          Multiforce, on standard patrol, try to learn of the 
                          latest Destron activity but only get a blip somewhere

                          at it, but causing massive tidal waves throughout the

                          to evacuate the people, the Destrons continue to steal 
                          energy from Atlantis. The Breastforce then attack, causing

                          is planning, Star Saber orders the Brainmasters to head 
                          into space to stop the Destrons. He then gets in contact 
                          with Greatshot and asks him to help. Before the Cybertrons

                          Nebula. Back on Earth, the Dinoforce attack a shuttle

                          knocks Roadcaesar backwards until he's caught by Greatshot. 
                          Deathsaurus then sends a bunch of meteorite bombs hurtling 
                          toward Earth, doing massive damage, even to his own

                          tries to stop Victory Saber, but gets blasted right 
                          back into the Fortress. However, Deathsaurus then blasts 
                          Victory Saber with his laser beam, sending him hurtling 
                          through space as the Space Fortress heads for its final

                          results. Liocaesar emerges and battles Victory Leo as 
                          Jan and Holi arrive. Star Saber takes Leo's gun and 
                          heads into the fortress with Jan and Holi. Victory Leo 
                          slams Liocaesar into the energy shield, pretty much
